        WARNING, CAUTION, DANGER, AND BEWARE!
   Gullibility Virus Spreading over the Internet!
****************************************************
WASHINGTON, D.C.-The Institute for the Investigation of 
Irregular Internet Phenomena announced today that many Internet 
users are becoming infected by a new virus that causes them to 
believe without question every groundless story, legend, and 
dire warning that shows up in their inbox or on their browser.  
The Gullibility Virus, as it is called, apparently makes people 
believe and forward copies of silly hoaxes relating to cookie 
recipes, e-mail viruses, taxes on modems, and get-rich-quick 
schemes.

"These are not just readers of tabloids or people who buy 
lottery tickets based on fortune cookie numbers", a spokesman 
said.  "Most are otherwise normal people, who would laugh at 
the same stories if told to them by a stranger on a street 
corner".  However, once these same people become infected 
with the Gullibility Virus, they believe anything they read 
on the Internet.

"My immunity to tall tales and bizarre claims is all gone", 
reported one weeping victim.  "I believe every warning message 
and sick child story my friends forward to me, even though 
most of the messages are anonymous."

Another victim, now in remission, added, "When I first heard 
about Good Times, I just accepted it without question.  After 
all, there were dozens of other recipients on the mail header, 
so I thought the virus must be true".  It was a long time, the 
victim said, before she could stand up at a Hoaxes Anonymous 
meeting and state, "My name is Jane, and I've been hoaxed".  
Now, however, she is spreading the word.
"Challenge and check whatever you read," she says.

Internet users are urged to examine themselves for 
symptoms of the virus, which include the following:
-- The willingness to believe improbable stories 
    without thinking.
-- The urge to forward multiple copies of such 
   stories to others.
-- A lack of desire to take three minutes to check
   to see if a story is true.

T.C. is an example of someone recently infected. He told 
one reporter,

When told about the Gullibility Virus, T. C. said he would 
stop reading e-mail, so that he would not become infected.

Anyone with symptoms like these is urged to seek help 
immediately. Experts recommend that at the first feelings of 
gullibility, Internet users rush to their favorite search engine 
and look up the item tempting them to thoughtless credence.  
Most hoaxes, legends, and tall tales have been widely discussed 
and exposed by the Internet community.

Courses in critical thinking are also widely available, and
there is on-line help from many sources, including:
